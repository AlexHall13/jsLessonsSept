/* 
BRONZE CHALLENGE
  Design a class component (called 'Heroes') that stores a 'superhero' array.  The object is below:
  [
    {name: 'Clark Kent', superPower: 'flight', age: 33},
    {name: 'Bruce Wayne', superPower: '$', age: 41}
  ]
  Pass the information from this array into a component (called 'DisplayHero') that
  displays a SINGLE hero.  'DisplayHero' will show name, superPower, and age to the page. The information 
  must be centered. 

  You only need to display one super hero with the 'DisplayHero' component.

  its own table.  The table and information inside each table need to be centered.
  
  Make sure both heroes are displayed on screen at the same time (two tables should be visible).
